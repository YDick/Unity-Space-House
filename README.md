1. (Dialogue, Ducking, 3D sound, Randomization) You will find a robot named Kyle in front of the house (on your left). If you approach him, he will speak to you. He has 4 possible dialogues. The background music will duck to make it easier to hear what he has to say. Kyle is an instance of 3D sound.

3. (Reverb, Reverb Change, SFX Changes Based On State) The reverb settings will change based on whether the player is inside or outside of the house
